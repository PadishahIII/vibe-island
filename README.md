Vibe Island keeps an eye on your local Codex sessions and surfaces state changes in a Dynamic Island-style overlay on macOS. It is designed for people who keep Codex running in the terminal and want lightweight visibility, fast approval handling, and quick access to recent conversation context.

## What It Does

- Watches Codex sessions through `~/.codex/hooks.json` and a local Unix socket.
- Expands from the notch area to show session activity, waiting states, and tool execution status.
- Shows recent conversation history with markdown rendering.
- Supports approval flows directly from the app UI.
- Tracks multiple sessions and lets you switch between them.
- Includes launch-at-login, screen selection, sound settings, and in-app updates.
- Falls back gracefully on Macs without a physical notch.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.6 or later
- Codex CLI installed locally
- Accessibility permission if you want the app to interact with window focus behavior
- `tmux` if you want tmux-aware messaging and approval workflows
- `yabai` if you want window focusing integrations

## Install

Download the latest release from GitHub, or build it locally with Xcode.

For a debug build:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme CodexIsland -configuration Debug build
```

For a release build:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

The exported Vibe Island app bundle is written to `build/export/Vibe Island.app`.

If no Apple team is configured, `./scripts/build.sh` archives the app and exports an unsigned `.app` bundle for local use. To produce a signed `Developer ID` export, run it with `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<YourTeamID>` or `VIBE_ISLAND_TEAM_ID=<YourTeamID>`.

## How It Works

On first launch, Vibe Island installs a managed hook script into `~/.codex/hooks/` and updates `~/.codex/hooks.json`. The hook helper forwards Codex hook events to the app over a Unix domain socket, and the app reconciles those events with transcript data to keep session state accurate.

The current architecture is still hooks-first inside the macOS app process. The `sidecar/` directory is a reserved Rust scaffold for future work around transcript parsing, state aggregation, and IPC.

## Project Layout

- `CodexIsland/App/`: app lifecycle and window bootstrap
- `CodexIsland/Core/`: shared settings, geometry, and screen selection
- `CodexIsland/Services/`: hooks, session parsing, tmux integration, updates, and window management
- `CodexIsland/UI/`: notch views, menu UI, chat UI, and reusable components
- `CodexIsland/Resources/`: bundled scripts such as `vibe-island-state.py`
- `scripts/`: build, signing, notarization, and release helpers
- `sidecar/`: future Rust sidecar scaffold

## Privacy

The app currently initializes Mixpanel for anonymous product analytics and Sparkle for app updates.

Tracked analytics are intended to cover app launch and session lifecycle metadata such as:

- app version and build number
- macOS version
- detected Codex version
- session start events

The repository does not claim to collect conversation content in analytics, but you should still review the source and decide whether that tradeoff matches your environment before distributing it broadly.

## Development

Open the project in Xcode for day-to-day work. The repository also includes release automation for signing, notarization, DMG creation, appcast generation, and optional GitHub release publishing:

```bash
./scripts/create-release.sh
```

`./scripts/create-release.sh` assumes the app has already been signed for `Developer ID`. If you only ran an unsigned local export, rerun `./scripts/build.sh` with a valid team ID before creating a release.

If you change anything under `CodexIsland/Services/Hooks/` or `CodexIsland/Resources/vibe-island-state.py`, treat it as user-impacting local environment behavior and verify it carefully.

## Acknowledgements

Vibe Island builds on the original ideas and earlier implementation work from [`farouqaldori/claude-island`](https://github.com/farouqaldori/claude-island). Thanks to Farouq Aldori and the upstream contributors for laying the foundation this Codex-focused version continues from.
